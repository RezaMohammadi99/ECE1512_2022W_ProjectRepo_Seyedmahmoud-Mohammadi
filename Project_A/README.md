Where you can find my code:


For MNIST-1D go to Project_A/MNIST1D.ipynb:

I wrote:

Model Creation, find model summary

Training the model, find training epoch logs

Plotting the training progress, where I answer all the performance analytics

Under explanation,
  I wrote plotting examples of classification
  
  my SHAP implementation for MNIST 1D can be found
  
  Exmaps, to create the explanation map comparisons
  
  I modified the drop rate average code to find increase rate and test my SHAP implementation

For HMT go to Project_A/HMT.ipynb: 
I wrote:

  Under explanation, plotting examples of classification
  
  Plotting training progress, to answer all the performance analytics
  
  SHAP, my SHAP implementation for the HMT set
  
  Plot the Results, I changed to compare my implementation to Grad-CAM
  
  Drop rate calculation, I changed to get increase rate and compare the algorithms
  
A copy of my SHAP implementation for both datasets can be found at Project_A/SHAP.ipynb
