#Project B

# MNIST
All the code for the MNIST section of my code is in Task1.ipynb
I have included my trained models in mnist_models.zip

# MHIST
I trained the teacher in teacher_transfer_learning.ipynb
I trained the student with knowledge distillation in transfer_learning_student_KD.ipynb
I trained the student from scratch in transfer_learning_studentwithoutKD.ipynb
I did all the evaluation metrics in Task2.ipynb

My models for MHIST were too large to upload, they can be generated using the code.
